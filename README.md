# Horiseon Accessibility Refactor

## Description
The HTML and CSS code for the Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. website was refactored to be accessible. Accessible code or semantic code is easier to understand and explains the content better. Also, semantic code complies with accessibility tools for persons with disabilities. 

The following was done to refactor: new title, all div elements were deleted and replaced with semantic elements, alt added to images, links were fixed and elements were put into sequential order. 

## Usage
